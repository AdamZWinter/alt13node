### Description
♪Alt-13 (pronounced alt thirteen) is a blockchain and cryptocurrency with the following intentions:
* Nodes are owned and operated by section 501(c)(3) charitable, educational, 
   and scientific corporations.
* The network is capable of transaction throughput levels that can 
   accommodate all modern commerce.
* Transaction fees are a source of revenue for the node operators.
* The general population can contribute to the charity of their choice 
   simply by choosing which nodes to route their transactions to; thereby
   dedicating the transaction fees to those organizations.

Additional goals:
* There is a built-in platform for private entities to issue, manage, and
 accept digital gift cards.
* There is a built-in platform for staking digital gift cards as a means for backing and minting
  a stablecoin (♪Notes), and a frictionless way for for-profit businesses to make donations.
* There is a built-in platform for private lending, and the automation of payments on debts.
* Through stake-in-identity, there is a built-in platform for lenders to become 
  certificate authorities for identity management.
* There is a built-in platform for businesses to take credit payments from customers through
  established relationships with lenders.
