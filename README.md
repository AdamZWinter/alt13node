### Description
♪Alt-13 is a blockchain, cryptocurrency, and ecosystem with the following intentions:
* Nodes are owned and operated by section 501(c)(3) charitable, educational, 
   and scientific corporations.
* The network is capable of transaction throughput levels that can 
   accommodate all modern commerce.
* Transaction fees are a source of revenue/funding for the node operators.
* The general population can contribute to the charity of their choice 
   simply by choosing which nodes to route their transactions to; thereby
   dedicating the transaction fees to those organizations.

Additional goals:
* There is a built-in platform for private entities to issue, manage, and
 accept digital gift cards.
* There is a built-in platform for staking digital gift cards as a means for backing and minting
  a stablecoin (♪Notes), and a frictionless way for private entities to make donations.
* There is a built-in platform for private lending, and the automation of payments on debts.
* Through stake-in-identity, there is a built-in platform for lenders to become 
  certificate authorities for identity management.
* There is a built-in platform for businesses to take credit payments from customers through
  established relationships with lenders.

## How to:
* Running ./buildfront.sh will pull the submodule repo for the React app frontend, build it, 
  and copy the build into the static resources directory.
  (You will need to 'npm install' and 'npm install react-scripts' one time, within the submodule
   directory, before this script will work).
